# opencode-action

Run an [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) agent from GitHub issue and pull request comments.

[![CI](https://github.com/dceoy/opencode-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dceoy/opencode-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Quick start

### 1. Add a provider secret

In **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add the API key for your model provider. The example below uses `OPENCODE_API_KEY`.

### 2. Add the workflow

Create `.github/workflows/opencode.yml`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
---
name: OpenCode
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
  id-token: write
jobs:
  opencode:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '/oc') || contains(github.event.comment.body, '/opencode')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1  # v7.0.1
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - name: Run OpenCode
        uses: dceoy/opencode-action@e5a3599d8b64f9adda6a03a18c8b0b9d077ffebb  # v0.7.0
        env:
          OPENCODE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENCODE_API_KEY }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        with:
          model: opencode-go/kimi-k3
```

### 3. Comment on an issue or pull request

```text
/opencode explain this issue
```

The shorter `/oc` trigger also works:

```text
/oc fix this
```

The default setup exchanges the workflow OIDC token for an OpenCode GitHub App token, which requires `id-token: write`.

## Reusable workflows

For smaller caller workflows, this repository provides reusable workflows for the mention bot and pull request reviews:

| Workflow                                                       | Purpose                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`opencode-bot.yml`](.github/workflows/opencode-bot.yml)       | Run OpenCode from trusted issue or pull request comments, or from a fixed prompt. |
| [`opencode-review.yml`](.github/workflows/opencode-review.yml) | Run the bundled `/review-pr` flow for `pull_request` events.                      |

See [Reusable workflows](docs/reusable-workflows.md) for caller examples, inputs, secrets, and permission requirements.

## Models and secrets

Set `model` to a `provider/model` value and pass the corresponding API key:

| Provider        | Example model                | Secret               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| OpenCode        | `opencode-go/kimi-k3`        | `OPENCODE_API_KEY`   |
| OpenRouter      | `openrouter/openrouter/free` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic       | `anthropic/claude-opus-5`    | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  |
| OpenAI          | `openai/gpt-5.6-sol`         | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     |
| Custom provider | `myprovider/my-model`        | Provider-specific    |

The provider account must have sufficient credits or quota. For providers not built into OpenCode, see [Custom providers](docs/custom-providers.md).

## Inputs

| Input                 | Default                   | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model`               | Required                  | Model in `provider/model` format.                                                                                                                                       |
| `agent`               | `build`                   | Primary agent. A slash command can override it.                                                                                                                         |
| `prompt`              | Event comment             | Fixed prompt to use instead of the triggering comment.                                                                                                                  |
| `mentions`            | `/opencode,/oc`           | Comma-separated trigger phrases.                                                                                                                                        |
| `variant`             | -                         | Provider-specific reasoning effort; leave empty unless supported. See [Custom providers](docs/custom-providers.md#variants-for-custom-providers).                       |
| `share`               | `false`                   | Share the OpenCode session.                                                                                                                                             |
| `use-github-token`    | `false`                   | Use the workflow token instead of the default App-token flow.                                                                                                           |
| `opencode-version`    | `latest`                  | OpenCode version to install. `/review-pr` requires 1.2.14+; the bundled Sakura provider's `chunkTimeout` needs 1.2.25+ (older pins fall back to the request `timeout`). |
| `use-bundled-toolkit` | `true`                    | Use the bundled agents, commands, skills, and configuration.                                                                                                            |
| `timeout-minutes`     | `60`                      | Stop OpenCode after this many minutes.                                                                                                                                  |
| `oidc-base-url`       | `https://api.opencode.ai` | OIDC exchange URL for a custom GitHub App installation.                                                                                                                 |

When `use-github-token: true`, keep `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `env` and grant only the permissions needed for the task.

Outputs are `opencode-version` and `cache-hit`. `cache-hit` is empty on review-only runs (`prompt: /review-pr`), which always skip the cache and install fresh.

## Pull request reviews

Set `prompt: /review-pr` to run the bundled read-only review through a dedicated permission-constrained primary agent. The command loads the internal `pr-review` skill, which reviews the diff along two axes — Standards (repo conventions plus a Fowler smell baseline) and Spec (does the change match the originating issue/spec) — in parallel read-only `review-worker` sessions, validates the candidate findings, and submits one review. Use `/review-pr` rather than loading `pr-review` directly when the enforced read-only boundary is required.

Each axis runs in its own fresh `review-worker` session so they don't share context; the parent validates candidates against the diff before submitting. Confirmed findings are posted as inline comments in a `REQUEST_CHANGES` review; a clean diff is submitted as an `APPROVE`. If the review identity can't submit that verdict — a self-review on your own PR, or an org that has not enabled GitHub Actions approvals — the helper falls back to a plain comment review.

To have the bot approve or request changes on PRs you authored, run the review with the default `github.token` (identity `github-actions[bot]`) and enable **Settings → Actions → General → Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**. A personal access token belonging to the PR author cannot approve that author's own PR.

See [Pull request reviews](docs/pull-request-reviews.md) for setup, supported review aspects, submission behavior, and security guarantees.
